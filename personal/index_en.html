                <span class="x">|</span>   My name is CHUNG-HSUN TSAI. I am currently studying at National Tsing Hua University.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   I am a sophomore student in the Department of Computer Science.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   I usually like to enjoy movies and listen to music, and occasionally try to shoot or edit some short films.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   Interested in various innovations or applications of multimedia.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   I learned about the course of Bilingual Web Design through the introduction of my classmates.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   My curiosity about various media makes me look forward to what I can learn in this course.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   After getting to know many practical tools, I also learned about the possibilities of web design.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   My hobby and expertise is photography, I often help clubs and camps to take photos and records,<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   but the style I usually like is street photography, and I like works of artistic creation.<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   I hope that in the future, I can use the web tools I have learned to build my own online photography exhibition,<br>
                <span class="x">|</span>   so that my works can be seen by the world.<br>
