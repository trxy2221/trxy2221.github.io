            <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The secret to happiness is to understand why we are unhappy, 
                which is, surprisingly, a difficult task.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: The thesis statement must be positioned in the very begining 
                or the very end of the opening paragraph.
            </p>

            <h2>Thesis Outlines</h2>
            <p>
                Exploring the unhappy side of us could actually make us happy, 
                because it really helps solve the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exploring the happy side is difficult, 
                because the pressure could be caused by multiple factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Procrastinated tasks are common problems, 
                and completing taasks usually help ease the anxiety.
            </p>
            <p><em>
                Note: You simply break your thesis statement  into multiple interrelated individual points,
                which you want to elaborate on in separate sections.

            <h2>Take-home Message</h2>
            <p>
                While dealing with our hidden pressure might not be a joyful experience, 
                it is a process that we must go through to truly live a happy life.
            </p>
            <p><em>
                Note: The take-home message must be inferred from the concluding remarks, 
                with keywords echoing the thesis statement.

            <h2>Essay</h2>
            <p>
                We live in a <span class="coherence">busy world</span>. 
                While most of the time we seem to be able to cope with a fast pace and seemingly endless jobs, 
                we might not see that our pressure is piling up along the way.
                When we can sense the pressure, 
                it might gave already grown too much as many different things have contributed to the problem. 
                The secret to happiness is thus to understand why we are unhappy, which is, surprisingly, 
                a difficult task.
            </p>
            <p>
                When our pressure increases, many of us could choose to avoid directly dealing with the pressure, 
                because it is easier to distract yourself from the pressure by, for example, 
                having some fun. However, when the fun comes to an end, 
                the pressure and the associated negative emotion would hit you again very quickly 
                - it is never successful to try to forget your pressure. To make your life happy again, 
                we really have to get to the bottom of your problem to truly solve it.</p>
