                <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    In the opening paragraph [<a href="example.html#sec1">Sec. #1</a>], 
                    the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. 
                    First, it contains the keyword <q>dementia</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. 
                    In addition, 
                    the key phrases before <q>symptoms emerge</q> indicates that the focus will be on early detection of dementia.
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    <q>Learning your odds of eventually developing dementia — a pressing concern for many, 
                    especially those with a family history of it — requires medical testing and counseling. 
                    But what if everyday behavior, 
                    like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, 
                    could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, 
                    reflecting the growing awareness that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">
                    the pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge.</span></q>

                        <p>
                            The topic of this section is made very clear in the first quoted statement 
                            in this section <q>Early detection is key</q>, 
                            and the rest of the section talks about why early detection is better, 
                            which is particularly indicated by the key phrase 
                            <q>the drugs are administered too late to be helpful</q>.

                            In the first statement of the section, 
                            the key phrase <q>For now</q> implies that this section focuses on the current approaches 
                            to the detection of dementia. 
                            Crucially, in the last statement, 
                            the author points of the problems with the current approaches using keywords or phrases 
                            like <q>expensive</q>, <q>invasive</q>, and <q>not available</q>.

                            The section header is based on the three alternative indicators of early demetia involving personal 
                            records, which are discussed the first three paragraphs in this section with key phrases 
                            like <q>monitor driving behavior</q>, <q>consumer credit report</q>, 
                            and <q>scrutinizes phone conversations</q> in the first statement of each of the paragraphs. 
                            The second half of the header addresses the doubts regarding privacy raised in the last paragraph of

                        the key phrase <q>Early detection</q> of dementia is linked back to the main topic of the essay,

                        the author also uses in recent years to tell the readers that the focus in this paragraph is changed to things that had just happened.

                <h2>Take-Home Message</h2>
                <p>
                    In the last paragraph of the entire essay, 
                    the author quotes the story of a participant taking part in the studies that 
                    investigate early indicators of dementia. 
                    In this story, the author's writing implies some positive aspects 
                    of understanding whether you have an early development of dementia. 
                    For example, the author shows that the odds of Alzheimer's disease is <q>lower than the participant had feared</q>. 
                    The author also quotes the participant's positive attitude toward the understanding of the risk 
                    despite the need to share their personal data, like <q>I would want to use them. 
                    I'd rather know than not</q>. Thus, we can see that in general, 
                    the author tries to convince people that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;"> there are more advantages than disadvantages 
                    to use your personal data to reveal your chance of having dementia and it's better to get fully prepared.</span>

                    <q>Paul Gondek, 68, who lives in Philadelphia and teaches social psychology at Drexel University, 
                    chose to learn his risk status two years ago, volunteering for several studies at the Penn Memory Center. 
                    Alzheimer's tends to run in families and, having watched his mother's slow decline from the disease, 
                    he knew he had a higher chance of developing it. To Mr. Gondek's relief, 
                    the PET scan showed that he did not have elevated amounts of amyloid in his brain. 
                    And a calculated risk score showed that his odds of Alzheimer's by age 85 were about 19 percent 
                    — higher than the 11 percent risk for the general population, but lower than he had feared. 
                    If other early indicators were available through driving or financial records or other behaviors and were reliable, 
                    he said, “I would want to use them. I'd rather know than not.”</q>
