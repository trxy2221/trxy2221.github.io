                <p>
                    In the opening paragraph [Sec. #1], 
                    the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. 
                    First, it contains the keyword <q>dementia</q>, which is discussed throughout the entire essay. 
                    In addition, 
                    the key phrases before <q>symptoms emerge</q> indicates that the focus will be on early detection of dementia.

                    <q>Learning your odds of eventually developing dementia — a pressing concern for many, 
                    especially those with a family history of it — requires medical testing and counseling. 
                    But what if everyday behavior, 
                    like overlooking a couple of credit card payments or habitually braking while driving, 
                    could foretell your risk? A spate of experiments is underway to explore that possibility, 
                    reflecting the growing awareness that <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;">
                    the pathologies underlying dementia can begin years or even decades before symptoms emerge.</span></q>
