                    the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement of the article.
                    This is the thesis statement because it summarizes the main idea of the passage, 
                    which is about the use of technology and computer modeling to 
                    modernize prescribed burns in order to make them safer, more effective, and less disruptive.

                        <p>
                            In this section, it is mentioned that scientists are using <q>advanced techniques</q>, 
                            including drones and various sensors, 
                            to collect data on prescribed burns in order to better understand how they can

                            It is also mentioned that while researchers have previously used advanced techniques to study wildfire behavior, 
                            fewer have applied these techniques specifically to prescribed fires, 
                            such as determining the best methods for clearing debris before a burn. 
                            The research is being conducted at the Blodgett Forest Research Station in California, 
                            which is home to a variety of tree species.

                        <p>
                            In this section, it is mentioned that prescribed burns can be made more effective by thinning the forest before the burn,
                            but this can also make the burn harder to control. 
                            It is also mentioned that <q>global warming</q> has led to more extreme heat and dryness, 
                            which can turn wildfires into <q>catastrophes</q>. 
                            The Forest Service's <q>mathematical models</q> for predicting how wildfires spread are not keeping up with the changes 
                            brought about by global warming, and the agency's investigation into a prescribed burn in New Mexico found that
                            the resulting fire was more dangerous and fast moving than anticipated. 
                            To help land managers learn how to conduct prescribed burns in changing conditions, 
                            a fire scientist has developed a training system that is similar to a video game.

                            They are collecting data by mapping the terrain with lidar, using a thermal camera to measure temperature, 
                            and using a multi-spectral camera to measure the dryness of the brush. 
                            The scientists are also burning small piles of wood and collecting smoke samples to study how embers travel and how fires spread out of control, 
                            as well as analyzing the chemical composition of emissions. 
                            These methods could potentially be used to <q>evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed burns</q>.

                            In this paragraph, it is described that the researchers at the Forest Research Station are conducting a prescribed burn
                            in order to maintain the health of the forest. 
                            The burn is led by a burn boss, 
                            who uses a torch to start the fire and leads a small crew in walking through the forest and setting lines of flame. 
                            As the day progresses, the fire grows in intensity and begins to spread rapidly, burning over 13 acres of land. 
                            The scientists observe the fire and gather data using various technologies, including drones. 
                            The burn is described as both a <q>natural</q> and <q>unnatural</q> way of safeguarding the land, and is compared to an art.

                    the use of advanced technology and computer modeling to improve the safety and effectiveness of prescribed burns</span>, 
                    a practice used to reduce the risk of wildfires by burning small trees, brush, and other materials that can fuel fires. 
                    The researchers are studying various aspects of prescribed burns, 
                    including the use of debris removal techniques and the impact of thinning on the intensity and control of the fires. 
                    The passage also discusses the challenges of conducting prescribed burns, including the cost, labor, and weather dependencies, 
                    as well as the risks of unexpected changes in wind and other factors. 
                    The passage also mentions the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires due to climate change, 
                    and the need for new methods and tools to manage these fires. 
                    Finally, the passage mentions the development of a training system using a video game-like interface to teach land managers 
                    how to safely conduct prescribed burns in changing conditions.
